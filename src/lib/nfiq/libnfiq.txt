 comp_nfiq_featvctr - Routine takes results from NIST's Mindtct and
                      computes a feature vector for computing NFIQ
 comp_nfiq - Routine computes NFIQ given an input image.
             This routine uses default statistics for Z-Normalization
             and default weights for MLP classification.
 comp_nfiq_flex - Routine computes NFIQ given an input image.
             This routine requires statistics for Z-Normalization
             and weights for MLP classification.
 read_imgcls_file - Routine opens a column-formatted text file
                    parsing in the first column of filenames as a
                    list of strings and the second column of
                    target image qualities as a list of strings.
 read_znorm_file - Routine opens a column-formatted text file
                   parsing in the first column of mean values as a
                   list of floats and the second column of stddev
                   values as a list of floats.
 znorm_fniq_featvctr - Routine Z-Normalized an NFIQ feature vector
 comp_znorm_stats - Routine takes a list of feature vectors
             (a matrix) and computes the mean and stddev for each
             column of features coefs in the matrix.
