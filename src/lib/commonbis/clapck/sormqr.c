       Univ. of Tennessee, Univ. of California Berkeley, NAG Ltd.,   
       Courant Institute, Argonne National Lab, and Rice University   
       September 30, 1994   


    Purpose   
    =======   

    SORMQR overwrites the general real M-by-N matrix C with   

                    SIDE = 'L'     SIDE = 'R'   
    TRANS = 'N':      Q * C          C * Q   
    TRANS = 'T':      Q**T * C       C * Q**T   

    where Q is a real orthogonal matrix defined as the product of k   
    elementary reflectors   

          Q = H(1) H(2) . . . H(k)   

    as returned by SGEQRF. Q is of order M if SIDE = 'L' and of order N   
    if SIDE = 'R'.   

    Arguments   
    =========   

    SIDE    (input) CHARACTER*1   
            = 'L': apply Q or Q**T from the Left;   
            = 'R': apply Q or Q**T from the Right.   

    TRANS   (input) CHARACTER*1   
            = 'N':  No transpose, apply Q;   
            = 'T':  Transpose, apply Q**T.   

    M       (input) INTEGER   
            The number of rows of the matrix C. M >= 0.   

    N       (input) INTEGER   
            The number of columns of the matrix C. N >= 0.   

    K       (input) INTEGER   
            The number of elementary reflectors whose product defines   
            the matrix Q.   
            If SIDE = 'L', M >= K >= 0;   
            if SIDE = 'R', N >= K >= 0.   

    A       (input) REAL array, dimension (LDA,K)   
            The i-th column must contain the vector which defines the   
            elementary reflector H(i), for i = 1,2,...,k, as returned by 
  
            SGEQRF in the first k columns of its array argument A.   
            A is modified by the routine but restored on exit.   

    LDA     (input) INTEGER   
            The leading dimension of the array A.   
            If SIDE = 'L', LDA >= max(1,M);   
            if SIDE = 'R', LDA >= max(1,N).   

    TAU     (input) REAL array, dimension (K)   
            TAU(i) must contain the scalar factor of the elementary   
            reflector H(i), as returned by SGEQRF.   

    C       (input/output) REAL array, dimension (LDC,N)   
            On entry, the M-by-N matrix C.   
            On exit, C is overwritten by Q*C or Q**T*C or C*Q**T or C*Q. 
  

    LDC     (input) INTEGER   
            The leading dimension of the array C. LDC >= max(1,M).   

    WORK    (workspace/output) REAL array, dimension (LWORK)   
            On exit, if INFO = 0, WORK(1) returns the optimal LWORK.   

    LWORK   (input) INTEGER   
            The dimension of the array WORK.   
            If SIDE = 'L', LWORK >= max(1,N);   
            if SIDE = 'R', LWORK >= max(1,M).   
            For optimum performance LWORK >= N*NB if SIDE = 'L', and   
            LWORK >= M*NB if SIDE = 'R', where NB is the optimal   
            blocksize.   

    INFO    (output) INTEGER   
            = 0:  successful exit   
            < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
